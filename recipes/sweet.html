        <li>1/4 cup (60 gms) yellow moong dal, washed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 gms) jaggery, grated or powdered.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) water</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ghee</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of saffron (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cashews, chopped and roasted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
        <li>Few strands of curry leaves</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <ol><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <li>Clean and rinse the rice and moong dal thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker. Once hot, add the curry leaves and let them crackle for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice and moong dal, and roast them for 2-3 minutes until slightly golden brown. Stir continuously to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Transfer the roasted rice and dal to the pressure cooker and add water. Cook for 3-4 whistles on medium heat. Alternatively, you can cook in a pan with water, covered, until the rice and dal are soft and mushy.</li>
            <li>While the rice and dal cook, prepare the jaggery syrup. In a small pan, combine jaggery and water. Heat over low heat until the jaggery dissolves completely. Strain the syrup to remove any impurities.</li>
            <li>Once the rice and dal are cooked, add the jaggery syrup, cardamom powder, and nutmeg powder (and saffron, if using). Stir well and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and reaches desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the roasted cashews and raisins. Give it a final stir and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional cashews and raisins, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
