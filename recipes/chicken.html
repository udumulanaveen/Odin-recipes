        <ol><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <li>Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with turmeric powder, 
            red chili powder, salt, and lime juice (if using). Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, 
            or up to overnight for deeper flavor.</li>
            <li>Prepare the masala: In a pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add curry leaves and green chilies, 
            and fry for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and fry until golden brown. Then, add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken and cook on high heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add garam masala powder and tomato puree. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add water if needed to adjust the consistency of the curry. Cover the pan and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with rice or roti.</li>
